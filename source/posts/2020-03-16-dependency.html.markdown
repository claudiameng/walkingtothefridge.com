They say that quitting smoking is hard. I would digress, and add that quitting people is harder. I don't mean specific people (think: toxic relationship), although that is certainly separately true as well. I mean People with a capital P. Read: the amorphous idea of having found your people. Of being in a context where you feel safe and loved and understood. Or perhaps the hierarchy of needs is

loved

<span style="display:inline-block; width: 3em;"></span>and understood

<span style="display:inline-block; width: 6em;"></span>and safe? It seems unclear. They are most likely complements rather than substitutes, which means that any calculation of overall utility will take the form of u(x1, x2, x3) = min{x1, x2, x3} rather than some sum or multiplication function between the variables at play. 

I miss my people so dearly. I am scared, too, that individuals I thought of as belonging to my people will fade once the proximity and convenience of our love is gone. Love is high maintenance, and boy are there so many people I love who seem ever so far away right now.

It seems necessary to end on a lighter note. Writers write often out of narcissism, just as much for their own benefit as for their intended audience. I've been told (by myself, largely) that it's important to learn to stand on your own two feet. Well, it seems like a damn good time to start learning. Until I get there (if I ever), I am thankful for moments of virtual connection that spark wit and smiles and a temporary amnesia of the admittedly desolate present condition. And of course, for stable wifi.
