Ignoring classes, <s>quarantine </s>social distancing is in many ways like the life I would have if I didn't need a job. Eventually I would like to reach this point of financial independence. I might still have a job, but I wouldn't <i>need</i> to.

How much wealth would I need to buy back 90 percent of my life? By buying a percentage of my life I mean that I would have complete freedom to choose how to spend my time for that percentage of my life, within biological, legal, and extreme financial restrictions.

Right now as a student I'd say I have control over somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of my time. I've chosen to go to school because I see it as a requirement for future financial stability. If I was already rich, I might still choose to go to school because it's fun, because I like learning, or because of social pressures to have a college degree. It doesn't matter if I would choose to go to school anyway (I think I would)--I count this time as not within my control because I have to make this choice to avoid wealth instability in the future.

I have a lot of freedom in choosing how to spend the 40 to 60 percent of the time I do control. Biological limitations are things like sleeping, eating, and pooping, where again, even if would choose to anyway, I'm forced to spend my time this way. I won't count this biological overhead in the whole pie of time that I'm hoping to buy. Legal limitations are things like I can't go on a mass murder spree, even if I wanted to. I would be living freely for at least the first murder, but eventually the government would severely curtail my freedom in how I spend my time. In the same way, other laws would make a desire to spend every day jumping off a different cliff difficult to achieve. So I won't count ways to spend my time that are illegal by human or physical laws as conditions for time that I "control." Finally, I could want to spend my time giving a pony every hour to anyone who wants one. This would get very expensive very quickly. The way I want to spend my time would quickly overtake any other cost in the calculation for how much wealth I need to achieve my wishes (like how an algorithm with a term polynomial in the input will quickly overtake a term constant in the input). Even Bill Gates can't wish to swim in a pool filled with a trillion dollars worth of gold coins, yet. So I will exclude ways of spending my time whose cost dominate the calculation for how much wealth I need. What I mean by controlling how to spend my time is relatively normal and cheap. Things like reading, writing, hobbies that have moderately high up-front fixed costs, sustainable variable costs, and the like.

Back to the original question. I'm interested in how much wealth I need to control 90 percent of my time. After I graduate the greatest time suck will be a job. Even if I'm doing something I enjoy for approximately 40 hours a week, the goal is to be able to not. To achieve 90 percent I think you only need to consider how to cover the expenses compensation from your job would. I'll call this the <i>wealth time threshold (WTT)</i>: the point at which you can literally turn your money into time, by all reasonable definitions (which I laid out above). I'll discuss going above 90 percent towards the end.

<h4>Getting to the wealth time threshold</h4>

What kind of things do people usually pay for once they have a job? I've only lived in the "real world" during two summer internships, so I'm extremely underinformed about this. But I'll try to make my best estimates, and you can let me know if I've forgotten something big.

<i>Housing.</i>

I think it's within the scope of controlling time to want to live close to any population center on Earth. Assuming that many people would probably choose to spend their free time on things like performing arts, living physically close to a concentrated industry is necessary, not just nice. So I should set the WTT at a point where living most places would not add significant financial burden. In 2018 the <a href='https://www.statista.com/statistics/1040698/most-expensive-property-markets-worldwide/'>most expensive housing market in the world is Hong Kong</a>, which is significantly more costly than the next few clusters of expensive cities. Hong Kong is a bit of an outlier, so I'll just pick a city which is more repersentative of expensive cities. I would probably want to live in San Francisco, where as of January 2020 the <a href='https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-francisco-rent-trends/'>average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,438 a month</a>.

I'll add some precision to what I would choose to make this number more realistic. I'm okay with not owning anything. The cities I want to live in all have high home prices, and I don't imagine staying in one place for many years. You might decide differently, and can play with this <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html'>incredibly detailed rent or buy calculator</a>. After some extremely cursory searching on apartments.com I found a studio apartment in the Mission District for $2,500 a month. I imagine software engineers with real jobs live in new high-rises in a more expensive neighborhood and own lots of minimalist Ikea furniture. The extra cost of that situation doesn't bring meaningfully more time freedom, so I won't consider it. I'm sure that at some point trying to minimize rent will prohibitively obstruct how I spend my time, but I don't have a good intuition for it now. I'd say that I have some tolerance for sub-optimal housing. At least in the Mission District, there's lots of good food. You can think about your own preferences in living conveniences and aesthetics. No-stakes apartment hunting is kind of fun.

I've never had to pay utilities separately during my summer internships, so I don't know how they work. I'm going to refer to <a href='qhttps://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/San-Francisco'>this cost of living estimator</a> a lot, which puts average basic utilities for a month at $153.55 as of this writing. I'll round that up to $200 to be safe. In total housing costs $2,700 a month.

<i>Food.</i>

Food is an easy place to cut costs. My friend <a href='https://guzey.com/'>Alexey</a> says he can live on $5 a day in food, I'm assuming if he can plan it. I'm unwilling to compromise on food, because I think it's one of the few things which bring me pure, unconditional happiness. One friend said that she thinks that gluttony, not lust (according to <i>The Divine Comedy</i>), is the least bad of the seven deadly sins, on the basis that it has the potential to hurt other people the least. I digress.

Referring again to the <a href='https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/San-Francisco'>cost of living estimator</a>, I'll budget $400 a month for food, including eating out once a week. I don't think you need this much to eat well, with good planning. But again, I won't cut corners here.

<i>Transportation.</i>

This is where I think I'll differ from what most people will decide. I hate driving, so I'm not going to have a car. By the time I reach the WTT, I'll own a nice road bike, a one-time cost which I won't factor into this. It probably won't help to consider the cost of buying a car anyway, with the relevant sustaining cost being gas and maintenance.

I'll say that transportation costs $300 a month, for random public transportation and rideshares. Perhaps this is slightly under what most Americans pay for gas every month anyway. A number of other caveats on this number--first, I'm living in a city, so if a car is necessary its additional cost is offset by a reduction in housing costs (public transportation outside the United States is also much better); second, San Francisco has nice weather, so there won't be months I'm snowed in; third, I don't expect to need to travel very far daily. There will be reasons to commute long distances, but not for regular reasons, like having a job. And if I still had a job anyway, I'll factor the commute under that income rather than the WTT.

<i>Insurance.</i>

Turns out health insurance in the United States is pretty expensive. Insurance and other considerations like taxation vary wildly depending on where I live, so I'm only going to do the math for San Francisco. Selecting solid (but not the best) medical, dental, and vision plans for <a href='https://shop.anthem.com/sales/eox/abc/ca/en/shop/demographic/snq'>Anthem in California</a> comes out to about $500 a month.

But even then, the plan isn't as good as the kind of plan you can get as a software engineer at a big tech company, in terms of coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximums. This is probably the best reason to still have a very chill job--for better health insurance.

Renter's insurance is something else to consider, but it's an annual cost, so not a determining factor. No car insurance because no car!

<i>Subscriptions.</i>

Cell, internet, Spotify, Netflix, iCloud, a gym membership, and maybe a <i>de facto</i> subscription to a nice coffee shop near where I live. I'll also lump household consumables here too. Very important to subscribe to toilet paper. Generously, $400 a month. There are some once-in-a-few-years costs like a new phone, or excessive clothing purchases, which might slightly increase this. But again, the determining factor is monthly costs, certainly not one-time costs every few years.

<i>Leisure.</i>

Two sorts of costs. Monthly leisure, purely for fun, $100 a month. Annual leisure, to visit home and other travel, $2,000 a year. Leisure and some monthly subscriptions I'd happily cut in the short term. These estimates are very comfortable for one person.

<i>Total.</i>

Annually, $53,600. Looking at this number I already feel wasteful imagining this as the cost of living for one individual. Many people are certainly at present doing a lot more with a lot less. But for now, better to overestimate than underestimate.

<i>Principal.</i>

The math to calculate how much principal I need is straightforward by comparison. I'll conservatively estimate an annual return of 5 percent on investments, and a withdrawal rate of 4 percent. My principal will grow 1 percent annually.

Then there is the matter of taxation. Where earlier we might have wished to live outside the United States to save on health insurance, now we're saved by taxes. In 2020 the <a href=https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/>long-term capital gains tax rate</a> is 0 percent up to $40,000, and 15 percent from $40,000 to $441,450.

So I need to withdraw 4 percent every year, and end up with $53,600 after taxes. So I need

(53,600 + 13,000 * .15) / .04 = $1,391,000 of principal

<i>A note on weighting.</i>

The annual return of 5 percent is another area where I might be thinking too safely. According to <a href='https://www.financialsamurai.com/historical-returns-of-different-stock-bond-portfolio-weightings/'>this possibly questionable source</a> a 50 percent weighting in stocks and a 50 percent weighting in bonds provided an average annual return of 5.4 percent, beating inflation by roughly 3.4 percent a year since 1926. That is 4.9 percent returns after inflation, taking into account every economic downturn since 1926 (the Great Depression!).

A 50/50 weighting is very safe. Maybe I will consider it when I really retire. I'm fine with a risker allocation of 80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds, which has had an average annual return of 9.5 percent. If I withdraw 6 percent annually, I would only need $925,833.33 in principal. What's the worst that could happen if I lose 34.9 percent of my money in one year (1931)? I'd have to get a job?

<h4>We have to expand <a href='https://youtu.be/a54ZcQXfxV4?t=94'>[*]</a></h4>

So let me say $1.3 million to reach the wealth time threshold. I'll forget about the $90,000 at the end and drink less coffee for a couple years. This is 90 percent of life, bought back. What's in the last 10 percent?

To get from less than 50 percent (where most people with jobs are) to 90 percent the main consideration is to avoid the job. To get from 90 percent to 95 percent I think the main consideration is labor. What's left in the 10 percent of time is things like cooking, cleaning, maybe a little wealth management, and other regular required tasks. Even if you enjoy cooking, surely you wouldn't <i>choose</i> to cook three meals a day, every day, pretty much in perpetuity? The next most effective step would be to hire part of the time of a personal chef, cleaning services, and someone to manage your finances. I roughly estimate that this will cost an additional $2,000 a month, bringing my required principal up to $2,081,000.

What about 95 percent to 99 percent time? These are trivial time sucks. Maybe it'll finally be the time to opt for the additional $2,000 in rent, to be closer to my favorite bike path, or to rideshare everywhere, since it's faster, or even business class, because the economy line at airports is always a bit longer...

The last bit of time, the closer to 100 percent, the costs grow exponentially. Like the energy required to accelerate a particle to close to the speed of light. I'm happy to set 90 percent as my target to translate weath into time. Beyond that, I'd benefit more from getting efficient at cooking than getting richer to cook less.

<h4>Feasibility</h4>

Okay, now the not fun part. You may have realized reading up to this point that this life is pretty lonely. It is an assumption of the WTT that things like getting married and having kids is not covered. Even having a dog would require recalculating, though the cost is well worth it.

Interpersonal relationships are clearly in the realm of reasonable things to want to spend time on. So I'd say that reaching the WTT is normally infeasible, even if you're thinking--"I can get a well paying job after graduation. I'd only have to save for X number of years, then I'll be free!" Maybe you're a software engineer, consultant, banker, whatever. Assume very generously that averaged over the first half decade of your career, you make $200,000 annually. And maybe you start with a $100,000 portfolio, thanks to a nice signing bonus and equity. It would take over six years before your return on investments cover annual expenses of $50,000, the amount you would have to spend during that time. Play with <a href='https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement?income=200000&initialBalance=100000&expenses=50000&annualPct=5&withdrawalRate=4'>the numbers here</a>. If I graduate when I'm 22, somehow with a job <a href='https://www.levels.fyi/charts.html'>at the high end of total compensation in a lucrative industry</a>, I'd still live under extreme not-in-control-of-my-time-because-I'm-saving until I'm 28. I'd be in the (probably significant) proportion of people no longer willing to undertake this. I'm writing to a subset of my friends about to graduate, so sorry if this is not relevant. Though I haven't talked about it, the great fortune someone must already have to even be able to consider pursuing this hasn't escaped me. In a sense, if I'm lucky enough to even just have the option of reaching the WTT, I'm already there.

Why not gain wealth via salary? I'd guess that the people <i>most</i> interested in having 90 percent of their time, maybe to pursue some high-risk creative project, self-discovery, or to maximize their time doing something they enjoy, would <i>least</i> want to resign over six years of their life to not doing <i>that thing</i>, whatever it is. If you have a real job you are giving up time, but gaining a lot in stability and convenience. Whatever people choose to spend their time on is their real passion. Trying to reach the WTT requires that your primary objective become generating wealth for at least a few years. In reality, wealth is always secondary, something necessary to let you do what you want.

So, I'm not going to grind for any more than a few years of my life to reach the wealth time threshold. I will be taking suggestions for get-rich-quick schemes so I can retire by 25. And you know, it's probably easier to scale an idea worth $1 million to $10 million than to make the first million...
